# Space Boost 🚀 

🕹️ Simple arcade style game built with Phaser3. 

🎮 Use the left and right arrow keys to boost up to the warp point and escape. 

⚠️ Be careful not to hit the moving obstacles though!

The project is bootstrapped using this [phaser-webpack-template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template.)
